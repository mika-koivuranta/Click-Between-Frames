# Installation

Install [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/install/) for Windows, then install this mod from the Geode index.

# What does it do

Click-Between-Frames multithreads user inputs, meaning inputs can occur in between visual frames. This can  drastically increase input precision on low framerates, such as 60FPS.
It's similar to TPS Bypass or Draw Divide, but with much less lag and (hopefully) far fewer physics-related bugs.

# How to use

To edit keybinds, go to the GD options menu and click the "Keys" button in the top right (Mega Hack rebinds won't work).
To enable right click input, use the mod options menu.
You must enable num lock to use numpad keys.

It is recommended to use either Physics Bypass or one of these FPS values: 60, 80, 120, or 240.
This is because 2.2 stutters on FPS values that aren't factors of 240 unless you enable Physics Bypass.

Disable TPS Bypass/Draw Divide when using this mod, because they're pointless.

The mod comes with its own version of Physics Bypass in the mod options. Be warned that not all lists or leaderboards that allow CBF will consider this legit!

# Known issues

- This mod does not work with bots
- Controller input is not yet supported
